A week into the [announcement](https://localpk.github.io/blog/building-information-platform/), I realised that I have already created some debt for myself. I am calling it time debt as it is taking much of my time.

I created few public channels for open discussions about the project only to realize that they would start to take more time than letting me focus on the actual project.

In retrospect, I have removed all those channels now that included a [Twitter handle](httpw://www.twitter.com/localcompk) and a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/643030409449705). However, I am going to keep the long-standing [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/localpakistan) â€“ the only place to keep up with project updates.

There was also an intent of keeping everything organised in this project. I think I went a bit extreme there too by dividing the project into parts on [GitHub organisation](https://www.github.com/localpk). Therefore retracting the overdone part and keeping main project together in one place makes sense. The content still live in their own repository and remain independent of the application.

Hoping that at least, this won't derail me from the main focus and I continue to work on adding more content for the launch. I am available on [Twitter (@jabranr)](https://www.twitter.com/jabranr) for any discussions in this regard.
